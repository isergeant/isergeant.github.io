Although this privacy notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not yet be able to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal data) until May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these changes.It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.

                    <br>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.

                    <br>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, events and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).<br>
                    <br>We will only send you marketing communications that we think may be of interest to you if you have already purchased services from us or have expressly given us permission to mail you.<br>

We have made decisions according to the limitation periods pertaining to our work to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes in most cases, and twelve years where the work involved a deed of any sort.In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Privacy Tools for further information.In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.&nbsp;<br>We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.<br>

                    <br>
                    <br>External Third Parties<br>• Service providers [acting as processors] based in the UK or EU who provide IT and system administration services.<br>• Professional advisers [acting as processors or joint controllers] including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the UK or EU who provide [consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services].<br>• HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities [acting as processors or joint controllers] based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.<br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">You have the right to:&nbsp;</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br>
                    <br>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br>
                    <br>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br>
                    <br>Object to processing of your personal data Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br>
                    <br>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:<br>(a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy;<br>(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;<br>(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br>
                    <br>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<br>
                    <br>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.<br>
